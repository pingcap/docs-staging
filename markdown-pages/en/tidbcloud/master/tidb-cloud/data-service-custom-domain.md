# Custom Domain in Data Service

TiDB Cloud Data Service provides a default domain `<region>.data.tidbcloud.com` to access each Data App's endpoints. For enhanced personalization and flexibility, you can configure a custom domain for your Data App instead of using the default domain.

This document describes how to manage custom domains in your Data App.

## Before you begin

Before configuring a custom domain for your Data App, note the following:

- Custom domain requests exclusively support HTTPS for security. Once you successfully configure a custom domain, a "Let's Encrypt" certificate is automatically applied.
- Your custom domain must be unique within the TiDB Cloud Data Service.
- You can configure only one custom domain for each default domain, which is determined by the region of your cluster.

## Manage custom domains

The following sections describe how to create and remove a custom domain for a Data App.

### Create a custom domain

To create a custom domain for a Data App, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**Data Service**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service) page of your project.
2. In the left pane, click the name of your target Data App to view its details.
3. In the **Manage Custom Domain** area, click **Add Custom Domain**.
4. In the **Add Custom Domain** dialog box, do the following:
    1. Select the default domain you want to replace.
    2. Enter your desired custom domain name.
    3. Optional: configure a custom path as the prefix for your endpoints. If **Custom Path** is left empty, the default path is used.
5. Preview your **Base URL** to ensure it meets your expectations. If it looks correct, click **Save**.
6. Follow the instructions in the **DNS Settings** dialog to add a `CNAME` record for the default domain in your DNS provider.

The custom domain is in a **Pending** status initially while the system validates your DNS settings. Once the DNS validation is successful, the status of your custom domain will update to **Success**.

> **Note:**
>
> Depending on your DNS provider, it might take up to 24 hours for the DNS record to be validated.

After your custom domain status is set to **Success**, you can use it to access your endpoint. The code example provided by TiDB Cloud Data Service is automatically updated to your custom domain and path. For more information, see [Call an endpoint](/tidb-cloud/data-service-manage-endpoint.md#call-an-endpoint).

### Remove a custom domain

> **Note:**
>
> Before you delete a custom domain, make sure that the custom domain is not used anymore.

To remove a custom domain for a Data App, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [**Data Service**](https://tidbcloud.com/console/data-service) page of your project.
2. In the left pane, click the name of your target Data App to view its details.
3. In the **Manage Custom Domain** area, locate the **Action** column, and then click **Delete** in the custom domain row that you want to delete.
4. In the displayed dialog box, confirm the deletion.
